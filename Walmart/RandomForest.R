# Read train and test data set
train = read.csv('train.csv', header = T, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
test = read.csv('test.csv', header = T, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)


### Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Clensing
# Identify missing entries between train and test data sets and remove them
setdiff(unique(train$DepartmentDescription), unique(test$DepartmentDescription))

# Remove Department that is NOT existing in Test data set
train = train[! train$DepartmentDescription == "HEALTH AND BEAUTY AIDS", ]

# Impute 1 to missing values [NA] for Upc feature
train[is.na(train$Upc), ]$Upc = 1	# Train - 4129
test [is.na(test$Upc) , ]$Upc = 1	# Test - 3986

# Impute 1 to missing values [NA] for FinelineNumber feature
train[is.na(train$FinelineNumber), ]$FinelineNumber = 1	# Train
test [is.na(test$FinelineNumber) , ]$FinelineNumber = 1	# Test

# Apply 'log' function to Upc and FinelineNumber features to reduce it dimensions [value spread]
train$Upc = log(train$Upc)
train$FinelineNumber = log(train$FinelineNumber)

test$Upc = log(test$Upc)
test$FinelineNumber = log(test$FinelineNumber)

# Factorize Weekday 
train$Weekday = as.numeric(as.factor(train$Weekday)) # Train
test$Weekday  = as.numeric(as.factor(test$Weekday))  # Test

# Factorize DepartmentDescription
train$DepartmentDescription = as.numeric(as.factor(train$DepartmentDescription)) # Train
test$DepartmentDescription  = as.numeric(as.factor(test$DepartmentDescription))  # Test

# Extract unique Target Trip Types
TargetType = unique(train$TripType)

# Create a mapping data-frame for actual TripType with "zero based" sequential ones
targetdf = data.frame(target = sort(TargetType), seqno = c(0 : (length(TargetType) -1)) )

# Change the Trip Type to 0 based sequential number instead of random using 'targetdf' dataframe
# Introduce a new variable called 'Target'
train$Target = 0

# Populate new variable with 'corresponding ordered sequence number' from 'targetdf'.
for (type in TargetType) {
	train[train$TripType == type,]$Target = targetdf[targetdf$target == type,]$seq
}

# Extract new "zero based" sequential Target
Target = train$Target

# Remove Target and TripType features from train data set
train$Target = NULL
train$TripType = NULL

### Model Generation
# Prepare Train Control 
# Do performance tuning by adjusting 'number of folds', CV Repeats or by adding more params
trcontrol = trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 4, repeats = 2, verboseIter = FALSE, returnResamp = "all", classProbs = TRUE)

# Determine Number of Classes to be predicted - Will be used for model generation.
RF_MTRY = length(unique(Target))

# Set no of Trees for Random Forest
# Do performance tuning by adjusting number of trees
RF_TREES = 225

# Prepare Tune Grid object
tGrid = expand.grid(mtry = RF_MTRY)

# Develop a model using Random Forest and the above params / objects 
rf_model = train(x = train, y = target, method = "rf",  trControl = trcontrol, tuneGrid = tGrid, metric = "Accuracy", ntree = RF_TREES)


### Prediction
# Predict the value
ypred = predict(rf_model, test, type="prob")

### Prediction
# Create Dense matrix  from test data set - Will be used for prediction.
testMatrix = as.matrix(test)

# Convert predicted values into Matrix as stated in sample-submission
predMatrix = data.frame(matrix(ypred, byrow = TRUE, ncol = RF_MTRY))


### Output
# Create column header for Output file
colnames(predMatrix) = paste("TripType_", targetdf$target, sep="")

# Combine column header and predicted values as data frame
res = data.frame(VisitNumber = test[, 1], predMatrix)

# Perfrom aggregation on Visit number by taking 'average'
result = aggregate(. ~ VisitNumber, data = res, FUN = mean)

# Write to Output file
write.csv(format(result, scientific = FALSE), '2-RandomForest.csv', row.names = F, quote = F)
