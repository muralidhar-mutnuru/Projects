Original data contains customer purchase records in rows of each purchased item. Columns include VisitNumber (visit ID), Weekday, Upc (item barcode), ScanCount (number purchased or returned), DepartmentDescription, FinelineNumber (detailed dept description) and the response, TripType. Several of the variables are categorical, which requires encoding. And the whole data set needs to be aggregated by the visit ID to correctly reflect information of each trip. Employed xgboost and Random Forest models to classify customer trips using only a transactional data of the items they have purchased. Performed feature engineering to better classify the trip type in a dataset with over million rows in training and test.
